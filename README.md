## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd kong-api-gateway
   ```
2. Copy the example environment file and edit as needed:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to set your credentials and settings
   ```
3. Start the stack:
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Accessing Kong Services

- **Kong Proxy:** http://localhost:8888
- **Kong Admin API:** http://localhost:9001
- **Kong Manager OSS (UI):** http://localhost:9002

Kong Manager OSS is enabled by default on port 9002 with basic authentication.

---

## How Kong Proxy Works

When a user sends a request to `http://localhost:8888/<route-path>`, the following happens:

1. Kong receives the request on port 8888 (host), mapped to port 8000 inside the Kong container.
2. Kong matches the request to a configured **Route**.
3. Kong forwards the request to the associated **Service** (your microservice), using the internal Docker network.
4. Kong returns the response from your service to the client.

**Note:**

- Kong does not expose your microservice directly to the host. All traffic goes through Kong for routing, security, and plugins.
- By default, Kong removes the route path prefix before proxying (`strip_path: true`). Set `strip_path: false` if your service expects the full path.

---

## Creating Services and Routes

You can create services and routes via Kong Manager OSS (UI) or the Admin API.

### Using Kong Manager OSS (UI)

1. Go to http://localhost:9002 and log in.
2. **Create a Service:**
   - Name: e.g. `django-api-gateway`
   - Host: `<your-service-container-name>` (e.g. `django-api-gateway-microservice`)
   - Port: `<your-service-port>` (e.g. `8000`)
   - Protocol: `http`
3. **Create a Route:**
   - Name: e.g. `user-details`
   - Paths: `/user/details/`
   - Methods: `GET` (or as needed)
   - (Optional) Set `strip_path: false` if your service expects the full path.
   - Link the route to your service.

### Using the Admin API

Example (replace values as needed):

```sh
# Create a service
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:9001/services \
  --data 'name=django-api-gateway' \
  --data 'url=http://django-api-gateway-microservice:8000'

# Create a route
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:9001/services/django-api-gateway/routes \
  --data 'paths[]=/user/details/' \
  --data 'methods[]=GET' \
  --data 'strip_path=false'
```

---

## Testing Your Integration

To test your microservice through Kong, always send requests to the Kong Proxy port (default: **8888**), not directly to your service.

**Example:**

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:8888/user/details/ -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

- Replace `/user/details/` and the header as needed.
- If your route requires headers or authentication, add them to your request.
- You can also use Postman or your browser for GET requests.

**Do not use your service's internal Docker port directly. Always go through Kong's proxy port.**

---

## Environment Variables

All configuration is managed in the `.env` file. See `.env.example` for a template. Example:

```
POSTGRES_USER=kong
POSTGRES_DB=kong
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme
KONG_DATABASE=postgres
KONG_PG_HOST=kong-database
KONG_PG_USER=kong
KONG_PG_PASSWORD=changeme
KONG_PROXY_ACCESS_LOG=/dev/stdout
KONG_ADMIN_ACCESS_LOG=/dev/stdout
KONG_PROXY_ERROR_LOG=/dev/stderr
KONG_ADMIN_ERROR_LOG=/dev/stderr
KONG_ADMIN_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:9001, 0.0.0.0:9444 ssl
KONG_ADMIN_GUI_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:9002
KONG_ADMIN_GUI_AUTH=basic
KONG_ADMIN_GUI_SESSION_CONF={"secret":"changeme","cookie_secure":false}
KONG_ADMIN_GUI_SESSION_SECRET=changeme
```

---

## Useful Commands

- Start: `docker compose up -d`
- Stop: `docker compose down`
- View logs: `docker compose logs -f kong`

---

## Extending

- To add plugins, configure them via the Admin API, Kong Manager, or with declarative config.

---

## Adding a New API Endpoint with Role-Based Access (Developer Guide)

When you want to expose a new API endpoint through Kong and restrict it to a specific role (e.g., `account_manager`), follow these steps:

### 1. Create the Service and Route in Kong

- Use Kong Manager UI or the Admin API to add your backend service and define the route (e.g., `/account/manage`).

### 2. Enable the JWT Plugin

- Attach the JWT plugin to the service or route to require JWT authentication.

### 3. Enable the kong-opa Plugin

- Attach the kong-opa plugin to the route or service.
- Configure it to call your OPA endpoint (e.g., `http://opa:8181/v1/data/kong/authz/allow`).

### 4. Update the OPA Policy (Rego)

- Edit the main Rego file (e.g., `api-authz.rego`) to add a rule for the new endpoint and role.
- Example for allowing only the `account_manager` role to access `/account/manage`:
  ```rego
  package kong.authz

  default allow = false

  allow {
    input.request.path == "/account/manage"
    some role
    input.parsed_jwt.payload.roles[_] == role
    role == "account_manager"
  }
  ```
- You do **not** need a separate Rego file for each endpoint; manage all rules in one file.
- You do **not** need to predefine all roles‚Äîjust reference them in your policy as needed.

### 5. No Need to Rebuild Kong for New Routes

- Adding new services, routes, or updating OPA policies does **not** require rebuilding or redeploying the Kong container.
- Only rebuild Kong if you change the Kong image itself (e.g., add new plugins).

### Summary Table

| Action                                  | Rebuild Kong? | Edit Rego? | Predefine Roles? | New Rego File? |
| --------------------------------------- | :-----------: | :--------: | :--------------: | :------------: |
| Add service/route/plugin                |      No      |   Maybe*   |        No        |       No       |
| Add/change access rule for a route/role |      No      |    Yes    |        No        |       No       |
| Add new plugin to Kong image            |      Yes      |     No     |        No        |       No       |

\*Edit Rego if you want to enforce new access rules for the new route.

## Note: Community Plugins and Kong Manager UI

- Community plugins like `kong-opa` (OPA integration) are not bundled with Kong OSS by default and may not appear in the Kong Manager UI, even if installed in your custom image.
- **Kong Manager UI only lists plugins that are marked as "visible" and "supported" in its metadata.**
- Community plugins often do not include the UI components or metadata needed for the Manager UI.
- **How to enable and configure the kong-opa plugin:**
  - Use the Admin API (curl, httpie, Postman, etc.), not the UI.
  - Example:
    ```sh
    curl -i -X POST http://localhost:9001/services/<service-name>/plugins \
      --data "name=opa" \
      --data "config.opa_url=http://opa:8181/v1/data/kong/authz/allow" \
      --data "config.input_path=parsed_jwt"
    ```
  - You can check if the plugin is installed with:
    ```sh
    curl http://localhost:9001/plugins/enabled
    ```
  - The plugin will work as expected if installed and configured via the API, even if it does not show up in the UI.

# üöÄ Managing Kong and OPA Configuration at Scale (Best Practices)

> **For large teams and production environments, follow these proven methods to ensure safe, scalable, and auditable API gateway management.**

## 1. Centralized, Version-Controlled Configuration

- **Store all Kong and OPA config as code** in a central Git repository.
- **Developers propose changes via pull/merge requests**‚Äîall changes are reviewed by the API/platform/security team before merging.
- **Restrict write access to production config** to a small, trusted group.

## 2. Kong in DB-Backed Mode (with Postgres)

- **Run Kong with a Postgres database** for dynamic, scalable configuration.
- **Apply changes using Kong‚Äôs Admin API** (never direct DB edits).
- **Back up the Kong Postgres DB** regularly, especially before major changes.

## 3. Automated CI/CD Pipeline

- **Test and validate** new routes/services and OPA policies in dev.
- **Export config changes** (e.g., with [decK](https://github.com/kong/deck)) or use scripts for reproducibility.
- **Promote changes through environments** (dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí prod) using CI/CD automation.
- **Sync Rego files to OPA** and reload policies as part of the pipeline.

## 4. Why This Approach?

- üõ°Ô∏è **Prevents config drift and accidental misconfiguration**
- üìù **Ensures all changes are auditable and reviewed**
- üîÑ **Enables safe, automated promotion of changes**
- üìà **Scales for large teams and complex systems**

## 5. Recommended Tools

- [decK](https://github.com/kong/deck): Declarative Kong config management (export/import/apply/diff)
- [OPA CLI](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#running-opa): Policy validation and testing
- **CI/CD platforms:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.
